OpenRouter provides a unified API that gives you access to hundreds of AI models through a single endpoint, while automatically handling fallbacks and selecting the most cost-effective options. Get started with just a few lines of code using your preferred SDK or framework.

Looking for information about free models and rate limits? Please see the [FAQ](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq#how-are-rate-limits-calculated)

In the examples below, the OpenRouter-specific headers are optional. Setting them allows your app to appear on the OpenRouter leaderboards. For detailed information about app attribution, see our [App Attribution guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/app-attribution).
