# Effect AI SDK

> Integrate OpenRouter using the Effect AI SDK. Complete guide for integrating the Effect AI SDK with OpenRouter.

## Effect AI SDK

You can use the [Effect AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect/ai) to integrate OpenRouter with your Effect applications. To get started, install the following packages:

- [effect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/effect): the Effect core (if not already installed)
- [@effect/ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect/ai): the core Effect AI SDK abstractions
- [@effect/ai-openrouter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect/ai-openrouter): the Effect AI provider integration for OpenRouter
- [@effect/platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effect/platform): platform-agnostic abstractions for Effect

Once that’s done you can use the [LanguageModel](https://effect.website/docs/ai/getting-started/#define-an-interaction-with-a-language-model) module to define interactions with a large language model via OpenRouter.
