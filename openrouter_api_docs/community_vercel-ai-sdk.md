## Vercel AI SDK

You can use the [Vercel AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai) to integrate OpenRouter with your Next.js app. To get started, install [@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider](https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/ai-sdk-provider):

```code-block text-sm

```

And then you can use [streamText()](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) API to stream text from OpenRouter.

TypeScript

```code-block text-sm

```
